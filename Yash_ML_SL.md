# Introduction To Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.It fouses mainly on the designing of systems,thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experience which is data in case of machines.

## Key Points :-
1. Data is in the form of Information.
2. Problem solving tool.
3. Combination of CS(Computer Science),Engineering & Statistics.
4. Interprets data & act on it.
5. Optimize performance criteria using past experience.

## Types Of Machine Learning :-
Machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are three basic approaches of ML :
