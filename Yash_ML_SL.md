# Introduction To Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.It fouses mainly on the designing of systems,thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experience which is data in case of machines.

### Key Points :-

* Data is in the form of Information.
* Problem solving tool.
* Combination of CS(Computer Science),Engineering & Statistics.
* Interprets data & act on it.
* Optimize performance criteria using past experience.

### Key Terminologies :-

1. Expert System.
2. Training DataSet.
3. Validation DataSet.
4. Test DataSet.
5. Target Variable.
6. Classification.
7. Regression.
8. Feature.

### Types Of Machine Learning :-

Machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are three basic approaches of ML :

* **Supervised Learning** :- Supervised Learning works under supervision.meaning the data that you have collected here is labelled and so you know what input needs to be mapped to what output. This helps you correct your algorithm if it makes a mistake in giving you the answer.

* **Unsupervised Learning** :- The data collected here has no labels and you are not sure about the outputs. So you model your algorithm such that it can understand patterns from the data and output the required answer. You do not interfere when the algorithm learns.
* **Reinforcement Learning** :- There is no data in this kind of learning, nor do you teach the algorithm anything. You model the algorithm such that it interacts with the environment and if the algorithm does a good job, you reward it, else you punish the algorithm. With continuous interactions and learning, it goes from being bad to being the best that it can for the problem assigned to it.

##### Now that you have a basic idea of what is Machine Learning and the different types of Machine Learning, let us move into the actual topic for discussion here and answer What is Supervised Learning?  Why Supervised Learning is important for real world solving problem?  What are the types of Supervised Learning? Supervised Learning Algorithms.

## What is Supervised Learning?:-

* Supervised Learning works under supervision.
* In supervised learning, you train your model on a labelled dataset that means we have both  input data as well as output data. We split our data into a training dataset and test dataset where the training dataset(like **If shape of object is rounded and depression at top having color Red then it will be labeled as Apple.**) is used to train our network whereas the test dataset acts as new data for predicting output or to see the accuracy of our model.

* In this image above you can see that we are feeding inputs as an image of apples and bananas to the algorithm as a part of the algorithm we have a supervisor who keeps on correcting the machine or who keeps on training the machines or keeps on telling him that yes it is an apple or  it is an banana , things like teacher teaches his students because the teacher already knows the results.
* The data set is used as the basis for predicting the classification of other unlabeled data through the use of machine learning algorithms.

### Why Supervised Learning is important for real world solving problem?  :-

* Supervised learning helps to solve various types of real-world computation problems.(for eg.Facebook uses face recognition when we try to tag someone,forecasting sales,weather detection).
* Supervised learning use for classification problem.
* Supervised learning is very useful in cyber-security.
> With the importance of Supervised Learning understood, letâ€™s take a look at the types of Supervised Learning along with the algorithms!

### Disadvantage :-

* Classifying big data can be challenging.
* Training for supervised learning needs a lot of computation time.So,it requires a lot of time.

### Application of supervised learning :-

* ***Spam Filtration:***  Detecting spam emails is indeed a very helpful tool, this filtration techniques can easily detect any sort of virus, malware . In recent studies, it was found that about **56.87%** of all emails revolving around the internet were spam in March 2017 which was a major drop from April 2014's **71.1%** spam share.
* ***Sentiment Analysis:*** It is a natural language processing technique in which we analyze and categorize some meaning out of the given text data. For example, if we are analyzing tweets of people and want to predict whether a tweet is a query, complaint, suggestion, opinion or news, we will simply use sentiment analysis.
* ***Speech Recognition*** : This is the kind of application where you teach the algorithm about your voice and it will be able to recognize you. The most well-known real-world applications are virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Siri, which will wake up to the keyword with your voice only.
