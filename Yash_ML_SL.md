# Introduction To Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.It fouses mainly on the designing of systems,thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experience which is data in case of machines.

### Key Points :-

* Data is in the form of Information.
* Problem solving tool.
* Combination of CS(Computer Science),Engineering & Statistics.
* Interprets data & act on it.
* Optimize performance criteria using past experience.

### Key Terminologies :-

1. Expert System.
2. Training DataSet.
3. Validation DataSet.
4. Test DataSet.
5. Target Variable.
6. Classification.
7. Regression.
8. Feature.

### Types Of Machine Learning :-

Machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are three basic approaches of ML :

Now we will move to supervised learning(SL)

## What is Supervised Learning?:-

* Supervised Learning works under supervision.
* In supervised learning, you train your model on a labelled dataset that means we have both  input data as well as output data. We split our data into a training dataset and test dataset where the training dataset(like **If shape of object is rounded and depression at top having color Red then it will be labeled as Apple.**) is used to train our network whereas the test dataset acts as new data for predicting output or to see the accuracy of our model.

* In this image above you can see that we are feeding inputs as an image of apples and bananas to the algorithm as a part of the algorithm we have a supervisor who keeps on correcting the machine or who keeps on training the machines or keeps on telling him that yes it is an apple or  it is an banana , things like teacher teaches his students because the teacher already knows the results.
* The data set is used as the basis for predicting the classification of other unlabeled data through the use of machine learning algorithms.

### Why Supervised Learning is important for real world solving problem?  :-

* Supervised learning helps to solve various types of real-world computation problems.(for eg.Facebook uses face recognition when we try to tag someone,forecasting sales,weather detection).
* Supervised learning use for classification problem.
* Supervised learning is very useful in cyber-security.

### Disadvantage :-

* Classifying big data can be challenging.
* Training for supervised learning needs a lot of computation time.So,it requires a lot of time.

### Application of supervised learning :-
